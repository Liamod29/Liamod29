## Hello and welcome to my landing page!

### My repositories:

My name is Liam O'Donoghue and I am an aspiring Data Analyst, and I am a recent Data Science graduate of HyperionDev. Within my profile you can find examples of my work to date. These showcase examples of my use of natural language processing, demonstrations of python functions and modeling data using jupyter notebook

### My work history:

I have worked for 10 years in financial services, primarily within the foreign exchange market. I have always had an interest in analysing data to assess market trends and movement within the market, and having always had an interest in coding as a hobby I've decided that I would love to return to financial services as an analyst. I have recently completed a data science course offered by HyperionDev so i hope to be able to use my new skills to break into a new role.

### A bit more about me:
I love learning, and I am currently studying and working on expanding my knowledge of SQL. Another little tidbit- I have written a childrens book, about a frog that cant get to sleep :frog:. This was inspired by my 3 year old daughter, who also often doesnt like going to sleep!
